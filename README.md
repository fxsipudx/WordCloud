# Word Cloud Generation

This project contains a Jupyter notebook for generating word clouds based on text data. Word clouds are a popular visual representation of the frequency of words within a given text, where more frequently used words appear larger and bolder. This notebook allows you to create visually appealing word clouds and customize various parameters to suit your needs.

## Features

- **Text Data Processing**: Reads and processes text input to prepare for word cloud generation.
- **Customization**: Allows customization of the word cloud, such as font size, color, layout, and background color.
- **Stop Words**: Filters out common stop words to provide a cleaner word cloud visualization.
- **Visual Output**: Generates a visual representation of the most common words in the input text.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following Python packages:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `wordcloud`
- `PIL` (for image processing)

You can install these packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib wordcloud pillow
